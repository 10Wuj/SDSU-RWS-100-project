<p><b>Argument:</b><br></p>
<p>Nobody can conclude that our world is not simulated because of technological advancements, and the proximity between reality and virtual games like <a id="in-text-link" href="breath_of_the_wild.html">"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"</a> that simulate reality.</p>
<br/>
<p>Throughout my website, I will be using the term simulation theory to describe the theory that we live in a simulation created by a more advanced species. I will not, however, argue that the simulation theory is true. Instead, I will argue that no one can be certain that simulation theory is not true. In other words, I will argue that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether or not the simulation theory is true or false.</p>
<br/>
<p>It is important to note that the simulated theory is a theory, which is defined as "an unproved assumption" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary. Therefore, the truth behind the simulation theory is uncertain. Uncertainty often causes doubt, especially because of how ludicrous the simulation theory may seem. In fact, simulated reality may seem absurd at first, but that should not be the reason to disregard the simulation theory. Even the CEO of <a id="in-text-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/about" target="_blank">Tesla</a> and <a id="in-text-link" href="https://www.spacex.com/about" target="_blank">SpaceX</a>,  Elon Musk, ponders over the possibility of the simulation theory in the <a id="in-text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8&t=125s" target="_blank">2016 Code Conference</a>. Some people will still argue that the simulation theory is untrue because technology could never become advanced enough to create a simulated reality as real as ours, so I will address this issue <a href="evidence.html">here</a>.</p>
