<p><b>Evidence 1</b></p>
<p>Technology has the potential to reach the point of simulating our reality because of the concept that technology keeps evolving. </p>
<br/>
<p>In 1972, Pong, a simple tennis simulation game, was released by <a id="in-text-link" href="https://www.atari.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Atari</a>. In 2016, the HTC Vive Virtual Reality Headset was released. In forty-four years, technology has evolved at an unexpected pace. The fact that technology keeps on improving indicates that technology has no limits.</p>
<br/>
<p>In "When did humans stop evolving," Assistant professor at Wast Texas AM University, Dr. Christopher S. Baird, notes that humanity will not cease to evolve. Baird points out that humanity has drastically evolved, and any "disadvantage that humans have... has been compensated for by human-made machines;" therefore, if humans are constantly evolving and we create technology to help ourselves adapt, then technology should also keep evolving. Advancement in technology demonstrates the possibility that technology can be powerful enough to support a simulated reality, so the simulation theory cannot be concluded as false.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Evidence 2</b></p>
<p>Many aspects in <a id="in-text-link" href="breath_of_the_wild.html">"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"</a> are shockingly similar to reality, which presents the possibility that our world is simulated.</p>
<br/>
<p>Aspects in "Breath of the Wild" like eating, sleeping, and walking mirror actions in the real world. The boundaries in the game seem to be the thing that separates the game from reality, but that is not true. To the user, the map seems to expand infinitely outwards. Once the user reaches the boundaries of the map, however, the game presents the user with an invisible wall and the following text: "you can't go any further."

</figure>
<p>Similarly, our reality is bound by our galaxy. Although scientists believe that space continuously expands, we cannot be certain because humanity has never been past the moon. Similar to the invisible wall, we are presented with boundaries because we do not have advanced enough technology. The similarity between boundaries and actions between video games and reality demonstrates that the chance of our world being simulation is not 0. </p>
