<p><b>About "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild":</b><br></p>
<p>Available on the Nintendo Switch and Wii U platforms, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" is a single-player, third-person video game, where the user becomes a character named Link. The game takes place in a large kingdom called The Kingdom of Hyrule. Although given the task of defeating the enemy, Ganon, who attempts to destroy Hyrule, the user has the freedom to do many other things. The game includes shrines, where puzzles, that lie hidden underneath the shrine, test the user's problem-solving skills; villages, where villagers provide tasks that come with rewards; forests, where the user can fight golems, lizards, and other creatures; and many other intriguing aspects.</p>
